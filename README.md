# iSmartSecurity
This was the final project for my BU MET665 class as part of my master's degree.

In this class I had to implement all of the things i learned in the class:
 * Software design principles
 * The object-oriented paradigm
 * Unified modeling language; 
 * Creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns
 * OO analysis and design
 * MVVM UI design pattern

# Description
iSmartSecurity is an application created in WPF using the MVVM pattern and the C# programming language. This application although small uses a fair amount of design patterns that were used to demonstrate the knoweledge acquired in the class. The idea behind this application is to use it with a camera to capture the face of the people entering a building and matching their employee profiles to be allowed to go into the building. One of the technologies used was Microsoft Cognitive Services for face recognition. This application is aming to automate how people enter a building without having someone at the main entrance checking people in.

This project should be compiled with Visual Studio
